0.2 (2016/06/28)
----------------

- Function calls are now less recursive by one level.

- Now using getcleanpath instead of getabspath.  It is simpler, and we
  don't need the strict features of getabspath.

- Added loader.bash-4 which strictly supports Bash version 4.0 and
  above.

- Also added loader-include-prototype.bash.

- Added support for MirBSD Ksh.

- Now using hash to remember location of executable binaries in some
  places that are applicable and helpful to improve performance without
  being completely explicit about the path.

- Reformatted messages to more proper case form.

- Reformatted changelog file.

- Some non-critical fixes.

- It's a complete code overhaul.

------------------
0.1.2 (2016/06/22)
------------------

- Fixed instances of `\"$__\"` which should be `\"\$__\"`.  It caused
  some scripts to be seen as not readable and not load when 'loader.sh'
  is loaded with advanced shells like Bash and Zsh.

- All advanced shell functions now use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for
  consistency.

- Simplified `[ ! ... ] &&` to `[ ... ] ||` in a getabspath function.

- We now check LOADER_CS_I if it's still set and has value > 0 before
  unsetting the element in LOADER_CS since Zsh gives an error if it's no
  longer set.  It happens when loader_finish is called in a called
  script.

- Now using "${!VAR_@}" instead of IFS=' ' and ${!VAR_*}.

- Now using 'printf' instead of 'echo' in a 'for' loop when applicable.

------------------
0.1.1 (2011/07/14)
------------------

- Added this changelog.

- Added an internal function for getting absolute paths in the generic
  script loader-extended.sh.  Normal shells are now independent of the
  external commands getabspath and awk.

- Fixed detection of the optional external command getabspath.  This
  time also, it will only be used if the newly added internal function
  doesn't work for the shell.

- No changes were made in other scripts.

0.1 (2011/04/09)
